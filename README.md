Our team was entitled as Meritorious Winner(Top 15% among 12446 international teams participating in MCM/ICM contest)

### Summary
We designed a mathematical evaluating model to measure the water scarcity level in a region, collected and pre-processed Lebanon’s water resources data from the United Nations website, developed a 15-year forecast of the water situation using grey forecasting and artificial neural network and provided an intervention plan to help relieve Lebanon’s water scarcity.
